/**
 * Extension of the {@link BeanFactory} interface to be implemented by bean factories
 * that can enumerate all their bean instances, rather than attempting bean lookup
 * by name one by one as requested by clients. BeanFactory implementations that
 * preload all their bean definitions (such as XML-based factories) may implement
 * this interface.
 * 扩展了{@link BeanFactory}接口，该接口将由可以枚举其所有bean实例的bean工厂实现，而不是像客户请求的那样逐个逐个地按名称查找bean。
 * 预加载所有bean定义的BeanFactory实现(例如基于xml的工厂)可以实现这个接口。
 *
 * <p>If this is a {@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}, the return values will <i>not</i>
 * take any BeanFactory hierarchy into account, but will relate only to the beans
 * defined in the current factory. Use the {@link BeanFactoryUtils} helper class
 * to consider beans in ancestor factories too.
 * 如果这是一个{@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}(分层Bean工厂)，返回值将不会考虑任何BeanFactory层次结构，而只会与当前工厂中定义的bean相关。
 * 也可以使用{@link BeanFactoryUtils}助手类来考虑祖先工厂中的bean。
 *
 * <p>The methods in this interface will just respect bean definitions of this factory.
 * They will ignore any singleton beans that have been registered by other means like
 * {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}'s
 * {@code registerSingleton} method, with the exception of
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType} and {@code getBeansOfType} which will check
 * such manually registered singletons too. Of course, BeanFactory's {@code getBean}
 * does allow transparent access to such special beans as well. However, in typical
 * scenarios, all beans will be defined by external bean definitions anyway, so most
 * applications don't need to worry about this differentiation.
 * 这个接口中的方法将只遵循该工厂的bean定义。它们将忽略通过其他方式
 * (例如{@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}的{@code registerSingleton}方法)注册的任何单例bean。
 * 除了{@code getBeanNamesOfType}和{@code getBeansOfType}之外，它们也会检查手动注册的单例。
 *
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> With the exception of {@code getBeanDefinitionCount}
 * and {@code containsBeanDefinition}, the methods in this interface
 * are not designed for frequent invocation. Implementations may be slow.
 * 注意： 除了{@code getBeanDefinitionCount}和{@code containsBeanDefinition}之外，此接口中的方法不是为频繁调用而设计的。实现可能会很慢。
